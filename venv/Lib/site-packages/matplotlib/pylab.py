.. warning::
   Since heavily importing into the global namespace may result in unexpected
   behavior, the use of pylab is strongly discouraged. Use `matplotlib.pyplot`
   instead.

`pylab` is a module that includes `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, `numpy.fft`,
`numpy.linalg`, `numpy.random`, and some additional functions, all within
a single namespace. Its original purpose was to mimic a MATLAB-like way
of working by importing all functions into the global namespace. This is
considered bad style nowadays.
